# dotCODES_Source_Control_for_VS
The dotCODES Source Control Maintenance Mainframe for Visual Studio (SCM2) is a console based parallel mainframe studio for dotCODES component development.


The program is deployed in 12 major components, each serve as a foundation for additional dotCODES subcomponents to be added in subsequent versions.

OVERVIEW-
The dotCODES infrastructure is written in Python, therefore it is generally a CLI console application. It contains libraries and modules from various high language compilers, server support from Apache modules and also from parallel programs such as UNIX/POSIX. The different libraries and modules are stored in one or more of the 12 components, along with the build application and its containers. Usage of dotCODES may require a novice understanding of IT management.
