          <p>dotCODES Specification Terminal</p>

<p>This document is an instructional manual for operating and maintenance of the dotCODES Specification Terminal. It lays out information to be used in installation and operating the prompts and its internal components.</p>

<p>Below is a general overview of the manual and the terminal's functions.</p>

<p>Dynamic and Discrete Logins 
Onboard Session
Terminal Prompts and Consoles
Class Directory
Output Types and Refactoring
Data Scaling
Encapsulation and Packaging
System Application Diagnostics and Exiting</p>

<p>Dynamic and Discrete Logins:
The two means of accessing the prompt's CLI environment are 
Dynamic- Complete attribution of author
Typically considered a human readable interface with advanced preferences for attribution and declaring classes.
Establishes complete access to runtimes and libraries.
Dynamically refactors and packages components built within the session.
Discrete- Robotic or automated access
Limited access to preferences.
Establishes and conducts audits.
Discreetly references reports for printing.</p>

<p>Onboard Session:
The process of accessing the prompt's CLI is called an onboard session. Each session is a distinct instance with concurrency via the session interface. Onboard sessions consist of one main board, called the dotCODES shell. Using shell access, a user may
Dispatch
perform any of the session functions and runtimes located within the CLI. 
Obfuscate
Encapsulate data for use with different languages.
Test
Conduct tests on the prompt's CLI.
Construct
Build new dotCODES components.
Organize
Archive, copy and place files, folders and directories.
dotCODES CGI
Open connections to repositories between directories and computers.
End Session
System Data</p>

<p>Terminal Prompts and Consoles:
Each session is an independent instance of the terminal, yet more than one prompt may be deployed. Prompts are one of three different CLI windows from which libraries and their properties may be utilized and maintained. Below is a listing of the three prompt windows:</p>

<p>Applet Prompt
Used to compute small strings and document designs.
Realtime Prompt
Used to execute more dense functions such as networking and media handling.
Bulkhead Prompt
Used to delegate enterprise grade features.</p>

<p>Each Prompt type may be used to create Consoles, which are user defined containers that may be fitted with a virtual prompt and packaged as a deployable extension for dotCODES applications. They may include dotCODES runtime extensions, library extensions, source control extensions and other classes.</p>

<p>Class Directory:
dotCODES prompts use the dotCODES Class Directory as its default class library. It is built upon a C++ base and encapsulated in a Python extension. It hosts UNIX and Windows, respectfully and interprets other library files from other vendors. Below is a general layout of the directory:</p>

<p>dotCODES Class Directory</p>

<p>Bracket Classes
Repository Prompt Classes
Actor Classes
Necessary Classes
Definitions
Operator Classes
Normal Web Services Classes</p>

<p>Bracket Classes-
Brackets are the least common denominator for all dotCODES operations. They create container 'space' for all other elements and toolsets within the environment. Brackets are used to tag commands and functions that are used by the console during code completion or execution. They also help establish boundaries between major device families and their specifications.
Below are the seven brackets.</p>

<p>Source Code IDE Bracket
Terminal CLI Bracket
API Bracket
PC and Machinery Bracket
Large Mainframe Bracket
Environmental Bracket
System Bracket</p>

<p>Repository Prompt Classes-
Repository prompts distinguish the many different API schemes in which the console may use during completion or execution. A repository may be accessed, commits performed, peer notes exchanged and many other functions in which the API may allow.</p>

<p>Actor Classes-
Actors are the special words or commands used to build operations in which the console will complete or execute. They are registered in the console and called by the bracket that it is encapsulated within. An actor may be a basic word or an array of string commands.</p>

<p>Necessary Classes-
Necessaries are declarations that can be appended to a bracket without starting a new session or writing to the definitions classes. They may be used to bind two or more documents by transclusion. They may also create new prompts, actors and operations.</p>

<p>Definitions-
Definitions are used to build class identity and generally announce all instances of a class in the open console. Definitions must be announced before a session in order to complete or execute functions. </p>

<p>Operator Classes-
Operators perform any maintenance within the console. They typically are used by the console's syntax to write commands and operations along with actors and brackets. An example line using all three would be:
[[T_ACT = "copy all"_"place*directory/subdirectory"_OPERA = "close console"]]</p>

<p>The above simply states: In the T bracket, use actors "copy all" and "place" to copy all files selected to the directory/subdirectory folder. The operator "close console is used to complete the session.</p>

<p>Normal Web Services Clasess (NWS)-
Normal Web Services classes build anticipated normal connections between the console and any web enabled network. They are differentiated for developers seeking secure connections during sessions. The classes may be emphasized based upon their TLD, URL, Web Address, HTTP class or any other normal connection.</p>
